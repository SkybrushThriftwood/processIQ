{# Prompt for generating post-extraction improvement suggestions #}
You just extracted process data from a user's description. Help them improve their input so the analysis will be more accurate and actionable.

## What Was Extracted

Process: {{ process_name }}
Steps: {{ step_count }}
{% if steps_with_time %}Steps with time estimates: {{ steps_with_time }}/{{ step_count }}{% endif %}
{% if steps_with_cost %}Steps with cost data: {{ steps_with_cost }}/{{ step_count }}{% endif %}
{% if steps_with_errors %}Steps with error rates: {{ steps_with_errors }}/{{ step_count }}{% endif %}
{% if steps_with_dependencies %}Steps with dependencies: {{ steps_with_dependencies }}/{{ step_count }}{% endif %}

{% if data_gaps %}
## Data Gaps Identified

{% for gap in data_gaps %}
- {{ gap }}
{% endfor %}
{% endif %}

## Instructions

Write 2-4 brief, encouraging suggestions for what additional information would most improve the analysis. Be polite and acknowledge that estimates are fine - we don't need exact numbers.

Guidelines:
- Start with what they did well (they took the time to describe their process)
- Focus on the 2-3 most impactful missing pieces
- Explain briefly WHY each piece of information helps (e.g., "time estimates help identify bottlenecks")
- Give concrete examples they can relate to (e.g., "roughly how long does each step take - even a range like '2-4 hours' helps")
- Keep each suggestion to 1-2 sentences
- Be encouraging, not demanding - every bit of information helps
- Avoid jargon; use plain language

Format your response as a short paragraph (2-4 sentences) that flows naturally, not as a bulleted list. This will appear directly in the UI.
