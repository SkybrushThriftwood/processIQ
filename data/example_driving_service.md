We are a driving service. We provide pick-ups and drop-offs for sick people or elderly, we drive school children, and we do group tours to events and back.

Requests usually come via phone, which takes 10 min, or via email. Email would be faster, but emails have low priority -- even though it only takes 5 min to process, it usually takes 1-2 hours before the responsible person actually opens the email.

After that we add the order to our system, which is a matter of 5 min. When we plan for the next week -- which driver drives where and does what -- and the order is for that week, we add it to the roster and assign a driver. The process of distributing the orders for the next week takes the manager roughly 5 hours.

During the week there are usually adjustments to routes because of unforeseen circumstances: drivers calling in sick, route changes, additional orders, etc. I would say it usually takes 10 min extra per order to handle that.

Then the driver comes into the office, picks up the order and we explain it to him -- answer questions about the route, the people, what to watch out for. Let's say that takes 10 min per order.

After that they proceed and fulfill the order. This completely depends on the kind of order. A one-way drive is quick. A doctor appointment for an elderly person can be 15 min drive, then 1.5 hours waiting, then 15 min back.

Then the driver brings back the order and our accountant processes it, adds it to his system and sends out the invoice. This is 10 min of work, but it takes about 2 hours before he gets around to it.

After that we wait for the money transfer -- no active time needed if it arrives within 2 weeks. Otherwise we send out a reminder, that takes 5 min. We never had trouble with people not paying, so no need to go further here.

We have 60 drivers and 4 office staff, including the manager and vice manager.

## Step 2: Upload Excel File

Upload `data/operations_costs_2025.xlsx` -- this is an existing internal cost report with different column names and some extra data. The app should extract the useful cost/error data and merge it into the table from Step 1.

## Step 3: Analysis

Click "Confirm & Analyze" to run the analysis.

## Step 4: Follow-Up

After reviewing results, demonstrate one of:
- Edit a value directly in the table (e.g., adjust a cost), then re-analyze
- Ask a follow-up question about a recommendation
- Change constraints in the sidebar and re-analyze
